# karthikraj04-Fraud-Detection-in-UPI-Transactions

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent UPI transactions using clustering (K-Means, GMM) and classification (Random Forest). It analyzes transaction patterns like amount, time, and sender-receiver relationships to identify suspicious behavior.

Dataset: 1500 UPI transactions (8 features)

Clustering used for fraud detection (K-Means performed better)
Classification used to predict transaction success (78% accuracy with Random Forest)
Insights: Higher fraud at odd hours and larger amounts
Visualizations: Boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots
